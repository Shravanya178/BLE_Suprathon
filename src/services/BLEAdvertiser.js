// 1. Native Android BLE peripheral code
// 2. React Native bridge to expose it to JS
// 3. Or use react-native-ble-manager which has better peripheral support

// For this MVP, both devices will use the central role (scanner/connector)
// and take turns connecting to each other or use a different discovery mechanism
