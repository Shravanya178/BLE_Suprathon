## 📋 TESTING SEQUENCE

Follow this **exact sequence** to test the app:

### 🚀 1. PREPARE ENVIRONMENT

**On both phones:**

2. Clear app data/cache for the app
3. Go to Settings → Bluetooth → Turn OFF
4. Wait 15 seconds (minimum)
5. Turn ON Bluetooth 
6. Wait another 10 seconds
7. Verify Bluetooth is enabled and functioning

### 🔧 2. BUILD AND DEPLOY THE APP

**From your development machine:**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd path/to/BlutoothChatApp

# Clean the project
npm run clean  # or equivalent clean command for your setup

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start Metro bundler with clean cache
npm start -- --reset-cache

# In a separate terminal, deploy to devices
npm run android
```

### 🔄 3. TEST CONNECTION PROCESS

**Step A: Launch Sequence**
1. Launch app on first phone (let's call it "Phone A")
2. Wait until completely loaded (you see device list screen)
3. Launch app on second phone ("Phone B")
4. Wait until completely loaded

**Step B: Connection Sequence**
1. On Phone A, tap refresh/scan button
2. Wait for Phone B to appear in the list (about 5 seconds)
3. Wait 3 more seconds
4. Tap on Phone B in the list to connect
5. Wait for "Connected via Bluetooth" to appear
6. Wait another 5 seconds without doing anything

### 📱 4. TEST MESSAGING

**Step A: First Message Test**
1. On Phone A, type a short message (e.g., "Hello")
2. Tap Send button
3. Wait 3-5 seconds
4. Check if message appears on Phone B

**Step B: Response Test**
1. On Phone B, type a response message
2. Tap Send button
3. Wait 3-5 seconds
4. Check if message appears on Phone A

**Step C: Multiple Messages Test**
1. Send 2-3 more short messages from each phone
2. Ensure all messages appear on both devices

## 📊 RECORD RESULTS

**Connection Success:**
- [ ] Phone A discovered Phone B successfully
- [ ] Connection established successfully
- [ ] "Connected via Bluetooth" showed on both devices

**Messaging Success:**
- [ ] Messages from Phone A appear on Phone B
- [ ] Messages from Phone B appear on Phone A
- [ ] Multiple messages work consistently

## 🔄 TROUBLESHOOTING

If messaging fails:

1. **Try Reversing Roles**

   - Let Phone B scan and connect to Phone A instead

2. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for "🚀 REAL BLE WRITE" messages
   - Check for any "✅" success messages or "❌" error messages

3. **Full Reset If Needed**
   - Completely uninstall the app from both phones
   - Restart both phones
   - Follow the setup procedure from the beginning

## 📝 EXPECTED LOG OUTPUT
