# 🔧 RENDER ERROR FIXED - "setOnMessageReceived is not a function"

## ✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & FIXED

**Error**: `_BLEService.default.setOnMessageReceived is not a function (it is undefined)`
**Root Cause**: Method name mismatch between ChatScreen and BLEService

## 🛠️ WHAT WAS WRONG

The ChatScreen was calling:
- ❌ `BLEService.setOnMessageReceived()` 
- ❌ `BLEService.setOnConnectionStateChanged()`

But BLEService only had:
- ✅ `BLEService.setMessageReceivedCallback()`
- ✅ `BLEService.setConnectionStateChangedCallback()`

## 🔧 FIX APPLIED

Added **compatibility alias methods** to BLEService:
- ✅ `setOnMessageReceived()` → calls `setMessageReceivedCallback()`
- ✅ `setOnConnectionStateChanged()` → calls `setConnectionStateChangedCallback()`

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE EFFECT

The render error should be **completely gone** now and your app should:
- ✅ **Load without crashes**
- ✅ **Connect to devices successfully** 
- ✅ **Open chat screen properly**
- ✅ **Set up message handlers correctly**

## 📱 TEST NOW

### Step 1: Reload Apps
- **Force close** both apps (they're probably crashed)
- **Reopen** both apps

### Step 2: Test Full Flow
1. **Start scanning** - should work
2. **Connect to device** - should work
3. **Chat screen opens** - should work WITHOUT render error
4. **Try sending message** - should work

### Expected Result:
- ❌ **No more render errors**
- ✅ **Clean app loading**
- ✅ **Smooth navigation to chat**
- ✅ **Message handlers properly set up**

## 🔍 CONSOLE CHECK

The console should now show:
- ✅ **Clean startup** without method errors
- ✅ **"Initializing BLE manager..."**
- ✅ **"Starting BLE scan..."** when scanning
- ✅ **Connection logs** when connecting
- ✅ **No render errors**
