# ðŸš¨ METRO BUNDLER FIX - "Unable to load script" Error

## Problem Description
After restarting your Redmi phone, the app is showing **"Unable to load script"** error message.

## Root Cause
This happens because:
1. The Metro bundler connection was lost when you restarted the Bluetooth
2. The cached bundle on your device became invalid
3. The development server (Metro) can't communicate with your app

## ðŸ”§ QUICK FIX STEPS

### Solution 1: Shake Device & Reload
1. Shake your Redmi phone to open the React Native developer menu
2. Tap on "Reload" or "Reload JS Bundle"
3. Wait 5-10 seconds for the app to reload

### Solution 2: Clear App Cache & Force Close
1. Go to Settings â†’ Apps â†’ BlutoothChatApp
2. Tap on "Storage & Cache"
3. Tap "Clear Cache"
4. Go back and force close the app
5. Reopen the app

### Solution 3: Restart Metro Bundler
**On your development computer:**
```bash
# Stop the current Metro bundler (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart it with:
cd c:\Users\Khushi\OneDrive\Desktop\suprathon\BlutoothChatApp
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

**Then on your phone:**
1. Force close the app
2. Reopen the app

### Solution 4: Check Metro Server Port
Make sure your phone and development computer are on the same network and that port 8081 is accessible.

If you're using a custom Metro port:
```bash
# Start with specific port
npm start -- --port 3000 --reset-cache
```

### Solution 5: Full Rebuild (If All Else Fails)
```bash
cd c:\Users\Khushi\OneDrive\Desktop\suprathon\BlutoothChatApp
npm start -- --reset-cache

# In a new terminal
cd c:\Users\Khushi\OneDrive\Desktop\suprathon\BlutoothChatApp
npm run android
```

## ðŸ”„ AFTER FIXING METRO ERROR

After resolving the "Unable to load script" error, continue with the BLE messaging fix process from **STEP 1** in the FIX_SUMMARY.md file.

**IMPORTANT:** If you're using a development build with Metro, the phone must maintain connection to your development computer's Metro server. If you need a standalone build that works without Metro, you'll need to generate a release build of the app.
